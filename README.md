## Credits

This project was created based off of some starter code provided by Xandromus. This starter code provided a few instructions on what functions needed to be created, but all of the actual code was written by myself, Sammi Moore. 

For the license badges and section of the readme generator, I used the following resources:
- https://choosealicense.com/ (To help with picking which licenses to include)
- https://shields.io/ (To generate the link to create the license badges)
- https://wisehackermonkey.github.io/badge-demo/ (To help with coloring the license badges and grabbing the license links)
- https://opensource.org/licenses/ (To borrow the license section text describing the terms of each of the licenses included in the readme generator)

For the general structure of the README.md and markdown syntax I used the following resources:
- https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma/blob/main/readme-guide.md (README.md structure)
- https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax (markdown syntax)

I also used the inquirer package from npm in this node.js application in order to generate user prompt questions. (https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)

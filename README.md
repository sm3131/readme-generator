# Professional README Generator

## Description

The professional README generator is an application that is run in the node.js environment via the command line. This application inquires users about each section of a professional README.md file. The application prompts users, and then collects of the user input in order to generate a finalized README.md file for their project.

## Installation
To install the README generator application complete the following steps:
1. Clone the application's code from this [GitHub](https://github.com/sm3131/readme-generator) repository onto your local machine into a new directory you create.
2. Open the command line and navigate to the directory you cloned this repository into, and open it up in a code text editor. You should now see the main files for this project (index.js, generateMarkdown.js, and package.json).
3. Next check to see if you have node.js installed on your machine by running the command *node -v* in your command line
4. If you have node.js make sure your version is up to date by going to this website (https://nodejs.org/en/)
5. If you do not have node.js installed follow the installation steps on this website (https://nodejs.org/en/)
<!-- 6. Once you have node.js installed, make sure you are still in the readme generator directory you created, and then run the following command *npm init* to initialize this application with npm and a package.json file -->
6. After you have node.js and your npm initialized, you will need to install the *inquirer* package from npm in order to run this application. You can install this package using the command *npm install inquirer*
7. Now that everything has been properly installed and initialized, you are ready to run the application via node.js using the command line.


## Usage
To use the readme generator application complete the following steps:
1. The purpose of this application is to generate a professional README.md file for your current and future coding projects, so if you are in need of a professional README this is the application for you. 
2. After you have completed all of the above installation steps, you can now either test the application to see how it works and what the prompts ask, or you can jump right into creating a README for your project.
3. To begin running the application in the command line, type *node index.js* and this will start the program.
4. If the program is running properly you should be confronted with user prompts that ask you to enter information that will be included in your newly generated README.md file.
5. After answering all of the user prompts, you should receive a message in the command line saying "README.md file created!"
6. Now go back to your code text editor and you should see a new README.md file that has been created, and it should be properly formatted and contain all of the information you included throughout the user prompts.
7. You can now use this README.md file for your current or future coding projects. You are also able to edit, add, and make changes to the information in the README.md file as you see fit.

## Credits

This project was created based off of some starter code provided by Xandromus. This starter code provided a few instructions on what functions needed to be created, but all of the actual code was written by myself, Sammi Moore. 

For the license badges and section of the readme generator, I used the following resources:
- https://choosealicense.com/ (To help with picking which licenses to include)
- https://shields.io/ (To generate the link to create the license badges)
- https://wisehackermonkey.github.io/badge-demo/ (To help with coloring the license badges and grabbing the license links)
- https://opensource.org/licenses/ (To borrow the license section text describing the terms of each of the licenses included in the readme generator)

For the general structure of the README.md and markdown syntax I used the following resources:
- https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma/blob/main/readme-guide.md (README.md structure)
- https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax (markdown syntax)

I also used the inquirer package from npm in this node.js application in order to generate user prompt questions. (https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
